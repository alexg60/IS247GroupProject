## 💡 Project Idea and Features  

The **Car Dealership Inventory Management System** is designed to streamline vehicle inventory tracking, sales, and trade-ins. Built with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**, the system allows dealership staff to:  

✅ **Add, update, and remove** vehicle records  
✅ **Track available stock** efficiently  
✅ **Manage trade-ins** and retrieve car values using the **Kelly Blue Book API**  
✅ **Search & filter** vehicles by make, model, year, price, body type, and color  
✅ **Automated pricing & interest rate calculations** based on customer credit scores  
✅ **Track sales per employee** and generate **sales reports**  

This system will provide a **user-friendly interface**, ensuring a seamless experience for dealership staff while improving overall efficiency in inventory and sales management. 🚀

## 🐳 Docker and Java Integration

As part of our project, we demonstrated how to compile and run a simple Java application using Docker. This helps simulate real-world deployment environments and adds hands-on experience with containerization.

### ✅ Java Program
**HelloWorld.java**
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Docker and Java!");
    }
}
