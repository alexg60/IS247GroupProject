## ðŸ’¡ Project Idea and Features  

The **Car Dealership Inventory Management System** is designed to streamline vehicle inventory tracking, sales, and trade-ins. Built with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**, the system allows dealership staff to:  

âœ… **Add, update, and remove** vehicle records  
âœ… **Track available stock** efficiently  
âœ… **Manage trade-ins** and retrieve car values using the **Kelly Blue Book API**  
âœ… **Search & filter** vehicles by make, model, year, price, body type, and color  
âœ… **Automated pricing & interest rate calculations** based on customer credit scores  
âœ… **Track sales per employee** and generate **sales reports**  

This system will provide a **user-friendly interface**, ensuring a seamless experience for dealership staff while improving overall efficiency in inventory and sales management. ðŸš€  

We used JavaDocs to add comments above our classes and methods that explain what they do. This helps others (and us) understand the code more easily.

The JavaDocs were turned into a website and saved in the /docs folder. We used GitHub Pages to host it online so you can view all the class and method documentation in your browser.
Here is the Java Docs URL: https://alexg60.github.io/IS247GroupProject/package-summary.html
